This small project is designed to offer useful Google Colab notebooks for a quick start with CrewAI.

Each notebook focuses on a specific topic or use case.

I've started with [sequential](https://github.com/alexfazio/crewAI-quickstart/blob/main/crewai_sequential_quickstart.ipynb) CrewAI examples, but I plan to add other crew setups soon, such as hierarchical and more.
