# Unofficial Quickstart Notebooks & More for CrewAI

Welcome to my CrewAI learning and testing repository! This project aims to provide helpful Google Colab notebooks to get started with CrewAI quickly.

Each notebook focuses on a specific topic or use case, providing explanations, code examples, and insights.

I've started with **sequential** CrewAI examples, but I plan to add other crew setups soon, such as hierarchical and more.
