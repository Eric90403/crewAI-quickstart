# Unofficial Quickstart Notebooks & More for CrewAI

Welcome to my CrewAI learning and testing repository! 

This small project is designed to offer useful Google Colab notebooks for a quick start with CrewAI.

Each notebook focuses on a specific topic or use case, providing explanations, code examples, and insights.

I've started with [sequential](https://github.com/alexfazio/crewAI-quickstart/blob/main/crewai_sequential_quickstart.ipynb) CrewAI examples, but I plan to add other crew setups soon, such as hierarchical and more.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas, improvements, or new notebooks to add, please submit a pull request.
